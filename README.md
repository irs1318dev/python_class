# Python for Scouting and Data Analysis
### Issaquah Robotics Society, FRC 1318, Issaquah, WA

This repository contains files that are used for an introductory course in Python that is conducted by the
Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS), a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based at Issaquah High School in
Issaquah Washington.

The course is divided into multiple sessions, each of which covers only a few topics. There is a Google Slides
presentation with instruction for every session available at this link:

Most beginning programmers will require some coaching from experience Python programmers in order to work
through this material.
